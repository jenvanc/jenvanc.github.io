    <p>Cookies are a perfect way of seeing the chemistry of baking at work. Just
    take a look.</p>

      <p>You can clearly see the impact of changing the ingredients in a simple
        chocolate chip cookie recipe. What is going on inside of that cookie though?
        What is is about changing these things that makes such a dramatic difference?
        First, we have to look at what each of our key ingredients are doing for the
        cookie.</p>

    <div>
        <table class="fancy_table">
		        <tr>
			        <th class= "fancy_table_member">Ingredient</th>
			        <th class= "fancy_table_member">Effect</th>
		        </tr>
		        <tr>
			        <td class= "fancy_table_member" id="butter">Butter</td>
			        <td class= "fancy_table_member">Butter is made of fats, water, and dairy solids. When the butter
              begins to melt, it begins to break apart into its key components.
              The water is released and makes steam, this is part of what makes
              your cookies light and fluffy.</td>
		        </tr>
		        <tr>
			        <td class= "fancy_table_member" id="eggs">Eggs</td>
			        <td class= "fancy_table_member">Eggs are the binding agent in your cookie, they are what makes
              your dough change from pliable to more structred and held together.
              Without the proteins in the eggs, your dough would not hold its shape.</td>
		        </tr>
		        <tr>
			        <td class= "fancy_table_member" id="sugar">Sugar</td>
			        <td class= "fancy_table_member">Sugar is a key factor in your cookies. The ratio of white to
              brown sugar, the temperature your cookie is baked at and how the suger
              is incorporated into the batter make a huge difference in the end result.</td>
		        </tr>
            <tr>
              <td class= "fancy_table_member" id="flour">Flour</td>
              <td class= "fancy_table_member">Flour is important because it creates gluten when exposed to moisture.
              Gluten is a kind of protein that helps trap gases inside the cookie
              to create rise. This is not the only thing that gives rise to your
              cookie and this is why you can sometimes substitue plain all-purpose
              flour for alternative flours like rye flours.</td>
